<h1> Biography: </h1>



I will always remember the first day I opened up a PC, It was in France where I am from. I was 13 years old when it happened. I was overwhelmed by the inside of the machine itself. I had no clue of what I was doing, but I knew I would like it. I will never forget my first real experience when I had my apprenticeship about computing. All those questions, curiosities and thought would finally be answered. I was very excited by the fact that I was finally going to touch, manipulate and get the experience from this apprenticeship. Three years later I moved from France to England with my parents. It was something difficult and different for me, not speaking the language, changing countries, friends, not having your family around you and especially when you found something that you really wanted to do.Therefore, it did not let me down because I knew I would find something similar in this country.
